				<h3>Hobbies </h3>
					<Ul>
						<h4>Psychology and Neurobiology classes 👩🏻‍💻</h4>
							<p>During quarantine, I decided to enroll in an online class on Coursera.com to learn other skills in a different area. As I am a curious person, and interested in the human brain, feelings and emotions, I wanted to know more about psychology and started a class called : Introduction to psychology, taught by Paul Bloom, teacher at Yale University. I'm now following another online course on neurobiology and the nervous system.</p>
						<h4>Calligraphy 📝</h4>
							<p>One of my favorite hobbies is writing, as well as learning calligraphy. I enjoy taking the time to write with pen, perfect my writing, and draw nice letters, for birthday cards, invitations, or other media. This helps me to develop my creative side, and to become more patient and rigorous. It also gives me a lot of serenity and calm, as well as a certain editorial ease.</p>
						<h4>Computer programming classes 💻</h4>
							<p>In June 2020, I started the online courses delivered by le Wagon to learn new skills and develop my competences, this time on a new and challenging area : computer programming. I have taken three different classes : - Develop your responsive website : HTML & CSS on SublimeText - Data Analysis - from Excel to Python - UK/UI Design for freelancers</p>
						<h4>Travelling and discovering new cultures 🌍</h4>
							<p>I have been fortunate since my earliest age to have been able to visit different countries with my family such as the United States, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Scotland, Tunisia, and Turkey. This fuelled my desire to discover new cultures and to develop my cultural openness. So, during my studies at IESEG, I chose to study for a year on the campus of the Universidad de La Salle Bajio in Leon, Mexico 🇲🇽, and a semester on the campus of the Università degli Studi di Bergamo, in Bergamo, Italy 🇮🇹. In addition, I chose to do a gap year internship in New York City 🇺🇸, between my Master 1, and my Master 2. These different international experiences enabled me to develop a real capacity of adaptation, and an open mind. I have always enjoyed integrating myself into a new culture and adapting to a city, or a new country. It is this desire to discover new things, and this taste for travel, that allowed me to learn Spanish and Italian, and improve my level of English. Meeting people and discovering new cultures made me grow and see the world differently. I am proud today to feel independent, and not afraid to step out of my comfort zone.</p>
						<h4>Making videos 🎥</h4>
							<p>During my exchange year in Mexico, I wanted to share my experience with my family who stayed in France, and started filming my travels, the cities I visited, with the people I met there. I quickly developed a real interest in creating videos, and I started my own YouTube channel to create captivating memories that I wanted to share. Creating a story through video fascinated me, and allowed me to develop my critical mind, my sense of detail, and my riguor.</p>

						<h4>Cooking 🥟</h4>
							<p>I have always enjoyed from an early age trying out new recipes, or following those made by my mother. This allowed me to learn quickly and retain recipes and tricks, but also to develop my creativity, my autonomy, my concentration and my attention to detail.</p>
